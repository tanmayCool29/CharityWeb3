## Introduction

The rise of blockchain technology has opened up new avenues for transparency, security, and decentralization across various sectors. In this project, we present a decentralized charity platform built on blockchain technology. The platform aims to connect donors with charitable organizations in various domains, providing transparency and trust in the donation process.

## Tech Stack

- DApp Server: Python Flask
- Blockchain Platforms: Ethereum and Hyperledger
- Smart Contract Language: Solidity
- Web3.js for interaction with Ethereum blockchain
- Ganache-cli for Ethereum test blockchain
- MetaMask for wallet integration
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development

## Usage
- Start DApp
- ganache-cli
- truffle complie
- truffle migrate  --network development
- python app.py


## Experimental Setup

- Dockerized Images: Docker images are created for Ethereum and Hyperledger platforms, including the DApp server and Ganache test blockchain for Ethereum.
- Deployment: Smart contracts are compiled and deployed on both Ethereum and Hyperledger blockchain networks.
- Front-end Deployment: The client-side application is deployed on a web server, accessible to users through web browsers.

## Result Analysis and Discussion:
The decentralized charity platform provides several benefits:

- Transparency: All transactions and interactions between donors and charities are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- Security: The use of blockchain technology enhances security by eliminating single points of failure and reducing the risk of fraud.
- Decentralization: By leveraging blockchain, the platform operates without the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and improving efficiency.
